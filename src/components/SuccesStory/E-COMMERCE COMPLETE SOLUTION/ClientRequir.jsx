					<h3>User Story</h3>
					<p>KIA-GTS LLC is a Dubai based company who were looking to get an e-commerce website and  
						Android/iOS app developed by some experts. They discussed with many companies before 
						finally finding us and found us to be one of the right technology partners. They were 
						looking for someone with whom they can work on a long term-basis. The managing 
						director of the company Mr. Francis Wills visited our Noida office from Dubai to 
						discuss the project requirement  in detail and meet our team. We built their 
						e-commerce website and the mobile apps successfully and as per their expectation and 
						got to be one of their technology partners on a long-term basis.
