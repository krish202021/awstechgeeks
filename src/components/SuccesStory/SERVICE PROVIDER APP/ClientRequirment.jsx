						<h3>How do we help them?</h3>
						<p>Worthmetrix LLC is one of our premium customers based in Georgia, USA. 
							The brains behind Worthmetrix are pioneers with 30+ years of experience 
							in the field of Finance and Legal. They wanted their experience to be given 
							the shape of an online platform that can help small businesses in understanding 
							their worth in statistical format. But due to an internal complex algorithm, 
							they were not sure about which company to trust. TGAYS Technology helped them 
							in not only building the entire web application but also implemented the complex 
							algorithm 100% correct programmatically. The end delivery was an error free Online 
							tool for the small businesses to use.
